    requirements and guiding the project. The product

    roles help to conect stakeholders and the development
    team.

    support the scrum process. They help the scrum team
    embrace and practice scrum principles. The product
    owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing
    the product backlog, they are the voice of the 
    customer.

c.  In a sprint cycle, the three meetings that occur are
    the planning meeting, the daily scrum meeting, and the
    sprint review meeting. In the planning meeting, the
    goal is defined for the upcoming sprint and the
    development team creates a list of tasks under that
    sprint. In the scrum meeting, the development team
    discusses their progress, and each team member 
    proposes questions. In the sprint review meeting, 
    it is a chance for the development team to present
    their work to the product owner and for the product
    owner to provide feedback.
